# nand2tetris
yet another nand2tetris build

Hello there! I'm about to start the postbacc CS program at OSU (Oregon State, not THE Ohio State). Mostly because I'm a little fidgety to get going, but also a little bit because folks on reddit say this is helpful, I'm doing a little prep beforehand. I owe the fact that this README exists to my former student Colt Steele, author of the excellent Git/Github course at udemy.com. Next up are his Python 3 course and the nand2tetris project. That's this.
